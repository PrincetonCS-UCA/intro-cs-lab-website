Congratulations on becoming a peer tutor! Please confirm that you understand these guidelines before you start tutoring by completing this affirmation form.
As a peer tutor, you have permission to look at the code of the person you are tutoring. It&amp;rsquo;s important, however, that you avoid looking at your own solutions while tutoring. That could inadvertently influence you to guide your student to a solution that would be so close to your old code that it would be flagged by the plagiarism software.</description></item></channel></rss>
