It provides an online marketplace where students can buy-out of attending their shifts using virtual currency. Prices are determined by the amount of notice given, thus incentivizing students to post their requests as early as possible. By using the platform, users no longer need to go through the hassle of finding someone to cover their shift or swapping shifts with someone else after posting their request.</description></item><item><title>How to Use Labqueue Password</title><link>https://introlab.cs.princeton.edu/how-to-use-labqueue-password/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://introlab.cs.princeton.edu/how-to-use-labqueue-password/</guid><description>COS 109, 126, 226, and 217 students, With Princeton coming out of the shadow of COVID, we wish to reimplement an in-person experience for students seeking help from Intro Lab TA&amp;rsquo;s. In order to make sure that students are in-person, we have added a password for attempting to join the labqueue. The password is randomized every day and seeks to ensure you are actually physically in the Intro Lab before adding yourself to the queue.</description></item><item><title>How to Effectively Use Intro Lab TAs</title><link>https://introlab.cs.princeton.edu/how-to-effectively-use-intro-lab-tas/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://introlab.cs.princeton.edu/how-to-effectively-use-intro-lab-tas/</guid><description>Dear COS 109, 126, 226, and 217 students, To help students get the most out of their interactions with Lab TAs, we have been working with the various course staff to clarify our guidelines. Before putting yourself on the queue, please make sure you have:
Identified a specific problem (e.g., instead of asking “is this correct?” ask &amp;ldquo;I am concerned that this will not work with large files but I am not sure how to test that&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;I am not certain my code meets the performance requirements because it takes a long time.</description></item></channel></rss>
