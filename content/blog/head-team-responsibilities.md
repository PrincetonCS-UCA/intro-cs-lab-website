**Once a semester:**

- interview Lab TAs
  - hire interviewers
  - schedule interviews
    - go through TigerUHR applications and select students to interview; students can list if 126 Lab TA or 226/217 Lab TA is one of their most preferred
    - note that for returning Lab TAs, we don't reinterview; just check their attendance from last semester and make a decision
  - create interview questions
    - usually use an assignment and add some bugs to it
    - for 126, there is just a 126 debugging; takes about 30 minutes
    - for 226/217, there is a 226 debugging, 217 debugging, 226 conceptual, 217 conceptual question; takes about 45 minutes, probably give 1 hour to be safe
  - use rubric
- hire lab TAs
  - hire on TigerUHR
  - 126: probably need around 25 full time
  - 226/217: probably need around 30-35 full time
  - a few subs for each is good
- schedule shifts
  - use [scheduling tool](https://labta-scheduler.herokuapp.com/); some manual adjustment may be necessary afterwards
  - things to keep in mind: 126 assignments are due Sunday, 226 assignments are due Monday, 217 assignments are due Tuesday/Thursday (check course website for exact schedule)
- train new Intro Lab TAs
- add new Intro Lab TAs to the Slack

**During the semester:**

- make announcements to students and Intro Lab TAs
- check attendance
- compile report to determine Lab TA job assiduity

**Once a year:**

- hire next Intro COS Lab Head Team
