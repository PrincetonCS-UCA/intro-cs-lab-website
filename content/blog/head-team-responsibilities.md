**Once a semester:**

- Interview Lab TAs
  - Hire [interviewers](https://introlab.cs.princeton.edu/responsibilities-of-the-intro-cos-lab-interviewers/)
  - Schedule interviews
    - Go through TigerUHR applications and select students to interview; students can list if 126 Lab TA or 226/217 Lab TA is one of their most preferred
    - Note that for returning Lab TAs, we don't reinterview; just check their attendance from last semester and make a decision
  - Create interview questions
    - Usually use an assignment and add some bugs to it
    - The COS 126 interview consists of a COS 126 debugging questions and takes about 30 minutes
    - The COS 226/217 interview consists of a COS 226 debugging, COS 217 debugging, COS 226 conceptual, and COS 217 conceptual question. The interview takes about 45 minutes, but interviews should set aside 1 hour to be safe
  - Use rubric
- Hire Intro Lab TAs
  - Hire using TigerUHR
  - 126: probably need around 30-35 full time
  - 226/217: probably need around 35-40 full time
  - A few subs for each is good
- Schedule shifts
  - Use the [scheduling tool](https://labta-scheduler.herokuapp.com/); some manual adjustment may be necessary afterwards
  - Check the course websites and communicate with course staff to determine typical assignment deadlines for each course such that staffing is more substantial prior to deadlines.
- Train new Intro Lab TAs
- Add new Intro Lab TAs to the Slack

**During the semester:**

- Create a direct channel of communication between the Head Team and the COS Introductory teaching faculty on Slack to ask questions pertaining to course specifics
- Make announcements to students, Intro Lab TAs, and course faculty:
  - When the lab opens for the term 
  - When is the lab closed for breaks or holidays
  - When the lab closes for the term (Dean's Date)
  - When running a satisfaction survey
  - When job applications open up
- Check attendance
  - Create and check absence and sub/swap forms that TAs fill out whenever they miss a shift. This way TAs can declare ahead of time if they are going to miss a shift and it's in our records
  - Check TA attendance regularly to follow up with TAs who haven’t been attending their shifts
    - [QTrack](https://github.com/PrincetonCS-UCA/QTrack) is a nice tool for looking at the students each TA has helped
    - These [scripts](https://github.com/PrincetonCS-UCA/head-lab-ta-scripts) are extremely useful for attendance statistics and information about how full the lab is during specific days/shifts
    - TAs that do not meet expectations can be fired
- Collect feedback from TAs and students about the lab
- Create blog posts and initiatives such as shadowing, apps, etc. to further the lab’s ability to help students

**Once a year:**

- Hire the next Intro COS Lab Head Team (end of Nov. - first week of Dec.)
- Build a transition checklist
  - Add the new Head TAs to the #lab-management, #lab-faculty, and #payroll-management channels in Slack
  - Transfer TigerUHR access to new Head TAs for viewing and hiring applicants for COS 126 and 2xx Lab TAs
  - Add new Head TAs to the PrincetonCS-UCA Github org so can update website
  - Get new Head Lab TAs a labqueue API key
  - Make sure the new Head Lab TAs are hired in the Undergraduate Manager position on TimesheetX
