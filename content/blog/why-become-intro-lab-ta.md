As part of the Intro Lab TA application process, candidates must complete an interview. [Visit this page to learn more about the interview process.](https://ugradjobs.cs.princeton.edu/docs/applicants/interview/) 

You can also learn about [all the other Undergraduate Course Assistant (UCA) positions in the Department of Computer Science](https://ugradjobs.cs.princeton.edu/docs/applicants/jobs/).

## Why would you want to be a lab TA?

- It's rewarding to help people! Yaaay!
- It's fun to help people with COS! Yaaay!
- You get lots and lots and lots of debugging experience!
- You get paid!
- You really get to know the 126 & 226 & 217 material!
- You get to see how other people approach the assignments that you have once done...which is always an interesting idea...

## Requirements?

- The only official requirements are that you have completed COS 126 (for COS126 lab TAs) or COS 226 **and** COS 217 (for COS226/217 lab TAs). You do not need to be a COS major or engineer.
- Other than that, being a baller at COS, so you understand the material, and also at teaching, so you can get others to understand it too, is pretty helpful.

## Becoming a Lab TA

- The CS department hires Lab TAs and undergraduate graders near the beginning of each semester, using the same initial application. Although you can sign up to get an early warning, applications are also usually sent to all majors and minors by Colleen Kenny, so watch your email at the beginning of next semester for details about when we're hiring!

## Here is some boring general administrativish information:

- Pay grade: $17/hr
- Full-time TAs are hired for two 2-hour shifts per week, and sub TAs are hired for 8 shifts over the course of the semester. 
- You are responsible for your own shifts -- so if you ever can't make a shift, you are responsible for finding a sub!
- There are lab TAing shifts during reading period!
