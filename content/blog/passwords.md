### COS 109, 126, 226, and 217 students,

With Princeton coming out of the shadow of COVID, we wish to reimplement an in-person experience for students seeking help from Intro Lab TA's. In order to make sure that students are in-person, we have added a password for attempting to join the labqueue. The password is randomized every day and seeks to ensure you are actually physically in the Intro Lab before adding yourself to the queue. Students will see the following image when they try to enter the queue.

This password will be written on the blackboards in Lewis Library 121/122. *DO NOT* share this password to other students. 


### Intro Lab TAs
You will see the password at the bottom of your labqueue page. Please write these on the blackboards in Lewis Library 121/122.
