# Brett Zeligson '24, Head Intro Lab TA

![Brett Zeligson](/images/people/zeligson.png)

## Tell us a bit about yourself, and what you have been doing at Princeton?
I’m a Junior majoring in Computer Science (BSE) pursuing certificates in Urban Studies, Finance, and Architecture/Engineering from West Orange, New Jersey. At Princeton, I’m involved in several student organizations including serving as an Advising Fellow for Matriculate, Head Web Design/Development Editor for The Daily Princetonian, and member of the Princeton Club Swim Team. In addition, I’m a Mathey Residential College Advisor in Mathey (go moose!) and serve on the Residential College Leadership Team. After graduating from Princeton, I’m planning on pursuing a career in Software Engineering, likely focused in the front-end direction.

## Why did you apply to be part of the Head Intro Lab Team?
I applied to be part of the Head Intro Lab Team because throughout my time in COS 126, 226, and 217, I frequently utilized the Lab TA program and grew so much as a programmer through the assistance I received. This connection to the program motivated me to apply for and serve as a Lab TA for COS 126 and subsequently COS 226/217 over the past two years. Further, as a student who entered Princeton with absolutely zero coding experience, I was motivated to lead the Lab TA program to encourage students who aren’t confident in their skills (especially first-time programmers) that they can indeed succeed in their Computer Science coursework.

## Tell us a bit about yourself, and what you have been doing at Princeton?
I’m a ’24 AB COS major with a certificate in Neuroscience from Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. On campus, in addition to the Lab TA program, I have been involved with performing arts groups including Theatre Intime, Princeton University Players, and Princeton University Rock Ensemble. Additionally, I’ve acted in and music directed various shows and am the MD for the Wildcats acapella group. I plan to work as a frontend or fullstack software developer after graduation. 

## Why did you apply to be part of the Head Intro Lab Team?
I became a grader for COS 226 in the spring of my freshman year, and joined the 226/217 Lab TA team in the spring of my sophomore year. Prior to this role, I have also served as a 2xx Lab TA interviewer. I’ve really enjoyed my time in this program and have learned a lot from helping students debug their code and teaching debugging practices. I’m excited to be part of the Head Intro Lab TA team because I wanted to be involved in the management side of things and am interested in improving resources for our Lab TAs.
