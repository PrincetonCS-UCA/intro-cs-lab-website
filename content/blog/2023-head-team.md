## Tell us a bit about yourself, and what you have been doing at Princeton?
I’m a ’24 AB COS major with a certificate in Neuroscience from Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. On campus, in addition to the Lab TA program, I have been involved with performing arts groups including Theatre Intime, Princeton University Players, and Princeton University Rock Ensemble. Additionally, I’ve acted in and music directed various shows and am the MD for the Wildcats acapella group. I plan to work as a frontend or fullstack software developer after graduation. 

## Why did you apply to be part of the Head Intro Lab Team?
I became a grader for COS 226 in the spring of my freshman year, and joined the 226/217 Lab TA team in the spring of my sophomore year. Prior to this role, I have also served as a 2xx Lab TA interviewer. I’ve really enjoyed my time in this program and have learned a lot from helping students debug their code and teaching debugging practices. I’m excited to be part of the Head Intro Lab TA team because I wanted to be involved in the management side of things and am interested in improving resources for our Lab TAs.
