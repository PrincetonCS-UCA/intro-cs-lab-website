**Once a semester:**

- [Apply](https://introlab.cs.princeton.edu/information-about-becoming-an-intro-lab-ta/) for either 126 or 2xx Lab TA position
  - if you are a returning application, you do not need to interview again
  - note that if you are a 126 Lab TA and wish to become a 2xx Lab TA, you will have to apply again. 
- Make sure you are on payroll and in the slack channel
- Fill out your shift preferences
- Begin your shifts!

**Every shift:**

- Open [labqueue.io](labqueue.io)
- Review relevant assignments 
- If you are the first shift of the day, write labqueue.io on the blackboards in Lewis, as well as the [password](https://introlab.cs.princeton.edu/how-to-use-labqueue-password/)
- Claim a student to help on the queue (please go in queue order)
- Once you are done helping a student, close them out on the queue
  - if you were unable to resolve their issue, reopen them on the queue
- After your shift, log your hours

**Throughout the semester, as needed**

- If you need to miss a shift, look for a sub/swap
