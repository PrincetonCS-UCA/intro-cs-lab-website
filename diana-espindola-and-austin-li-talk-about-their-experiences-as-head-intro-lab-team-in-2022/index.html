On campus, aside from my involvement with the Lab TA program, I&rsquo;m also a part of Colonial Club and enjoy playing pickup soccer on the weekends. Right now, my plans after graduation aren&rsquo;t set yet but I&rsquo;m waiting to hear back from graduate school applications.</p><h2 id=why-did-you-apply-to-be-part-of-the-head-intro-lab-team-1>Why did you apply to be part of the Head Intro Lab Team?</h2><p>I started as a 226/217 Lab TA my sophomore year and stayed in that role until the fall semester of junior year, at which point I applied for the Head Intro Lab Team. I love helping students debug their code, and the dynamic interactions each time kept the job fun for me. Having been in the lab for a while, I also wanted to explore the management aspect of it. Applying for the Head Intro Lab Team seemed like the natural step.</p><h2 id=what-are-your-takeaways-from-having-served-in-2022-what-were-the-challenges-you-were-proudest-to-overcome-1>What are your takeaways from having served in 2022? What were the challenges you were proudest to overcome?</h2><p>I think that being on the Head Intro Lab Team gave me the opportunity to see and deal with problems that I would never have thought of while I was a 226/217 Lab TA. From interviewing and hiring candidates to accomodating TAs during the semester, I enjoyed all aspects of running the lab. Probably the biggest issue in 2022 was COVID and how that would impact the lab. In particular, I&rsquo;m proud of the way we handled having a hybrid lab to accomodate students and TAs, but also shifting towards the in-person experience that makes receiving/giving help feel so much better. Working with Diana was a great time and I couldn&rsquo;t have asked for a better Head Intro Lab TA to work with.</p></content><p><a href=https://introlab.cs.princeton.edu/blog/intro-lab/>#intro-lab</a>
